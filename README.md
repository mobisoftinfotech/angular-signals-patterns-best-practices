# Angular Signals

This repository contains the code for the tutorial: [Angular Signals Guide: Architectural Patterns and Best Practices for Using Signals in Angular Applications](https://mobisoftinfotech.com/resources/blog/angular-signals-architecture-best-practices) by [Mobisoft, Web Application Development Company, Houston](https://mobisoftinfotech.com/services/web-application-development-company)

## How to Run the Project
To run the project locally:

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mobisoftinfotech/angular-signals-patterns-best-practices.git
```


### Install Angular CLI (if you haven't already)
If you haven't installed the Angular CLI yet, you can install it globally using npm:
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies: 
```bash
npm install
```

### Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

### Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
